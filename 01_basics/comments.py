# Comments in Python 
''' 
Comments are notes in your code that python ignores. 
They are for you (and other humans) to understand the code later.
'''
# Types of Comments 

# ===================================
# 1. Single-line Comments
# Use single-line comments (#) for short notes
# e.g: This line prints a greeting
print("Hello, World!")
# Note: Anything after # is ignnored by python.
# ===================================

# 2. Multi-line Comments
'''
Multi-line comment is the use of triple quotes (''' ''' or """ """)
for longer explainations
'''
# e.g: 
"""
This program calculates the area of a rectangle.
Formula: area = length x width
"""

length = 5
width = 3

area = length * width 
print("Area:", area)

'''
Note: This type of comment is useful for describing 
what the code does or giving detailed instructions
