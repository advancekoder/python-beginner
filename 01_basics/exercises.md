# Variables — Exercises (Beginner, adult-friendly)

## Exercise 1 — Basic variables

1. Create a variable `language` and set it to your favorite programming language.
2. Create a variable `experience_months` with the number of months you've been coding.

## Exercise 2 — Update values

1. Create `status = "Learning"`.
2. Change `status` to `"Practicing"` and print the new value.

## Exercise 3 — Numbers and types

1. Create `projects_completed = 2`.
2. Create `hours_per_week = 8.5`.

## Exercise 4 — Combine strings

1. Create `first_name` and `last_name` and print your full name using an f-string.

## Exercise 5 — Challenge

Ask the user for their name and age (use `input()`), then print:
`Hello <name>, you are <age> years old.`

Example:

```python
name = input("What is your name? ")
age = input("How old are you? ")
print(f"Hello {name}, you are {age} years old.")
```
