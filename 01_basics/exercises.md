# Exercises for Python Basics

# Variables — Exercises (Beginner, adult-friendly)

## Exercise 1 — Basic variables

1. Create a variable `language` and set it to your favorite programming language.
2. Create a variable `experience_months` with the number of months you've been coding.

## Exercise 2 — Update values

1. Create `status = "Learning"`.
2. Change `status` to `"Practicing"` and print the new value.

## Exercise 3 — Numbers and types

1. Create `projects_completed = 2`.
2. Create `hours_per_week = 8.5`.
3. Print each value and its type.

## Exercise 4 — Combine strings

1. Create `first_name` and `last_name` and print your full name using an f-string.

## Exercise 5 — Challenge

Ask the user for their name and age (use `input()`), then print:
`Hello <name>, you are <age> years old.`

Example:

```python
name = input("What is your name? ")
age = input("How old are you? ")
print(f"Hello {name}, you are {age} years old.")
```

# Operators - Exercises

## 1️⃣ Arithmetic Challenge

Task:
You have 3 mangoes, each costs ₦120. You also bought 2 bananas, each costs ₦50.
Calculate and print the total cost.

## 2️⃣ Comparison Challenge

Task:
Ask the user for their age. If they are 18 or older, print "You are an adult".
Otherwise, print "You are a minor".

## 3️⃣ Logical Challenge

Task:
You can only enter a club if you are between 18 and 35 years old AND you have a membership card.
Check if a 25-year-old with a membership card can enter.

## 4️⃣ Membership Challenge

# Comments - Exercises

## Exercise 1
Write a program to store your name and print it. Add a comment above each line explaining what it does.

## Exercise 2
Write a program that calculates 5 + 7 and prints the result. Use inline comments to explain each step.

## Exercise 3
Write a program that stores your age and tells you if you are an adult (age >= 18). Add a multi-line comment explaining what the program does.

## Exercise 4: Lets work on something challenging like a real life case
Write a small WHO WANTS TO BE A MILLIONAIRE program that:
* Asks the player to choose a Question (1, 2, 3, or 4).
* Gives them a Question (e.g., “Question 1: Which team won the 2022 FIFA World Cup?” 
                        or “Question 2: Which team lost the 2022 FIFA World Cup final”).
* Ends after the second choice and displays amount won if the answer is correct.

The twist:
* You must use multi-line comments to plan your game logic before you start coding.
* You must use inline comments to explain why certain lines are written a certain way.
* You must use single-line comments to describe major steps in the game.
